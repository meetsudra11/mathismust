    "A company claims that their email marketing campaign has a 15% click-through rate. If you randomly select 100 people to receive the email, what is the probability that exactly 20 will click through to the website?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ANSWER :\n",
    "\n",
    "- Customer will either click or ignore (2 classes)  \n",
    "- Means 100 simulations (n = 100). \n",
    "- 100 people selected randomly.Each person is independetnt as well.\n",
    "- Since Success rate is fixed and there are only 2 classes with 100 simulations, it might follow binomial distribution. P(X = x) = nCx * P(x)**0 * (1-P)**n-x\n",
    "- calculation will be as such.: P(20)=. 100C20 * ((0.15)**20) * (0.85)**80\n",
